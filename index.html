<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Iâ€™m Richard Barker and this is my GitHub home for software development.</p>
<p>For some years I coded using closed source software now I'm moving to Python and C++. My particular interest is weather monitoring and reporting systems that will operate in remote locations and communicate with servers over cellular networks and LoRa packet radio.</p>
